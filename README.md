# Dragon-s-Lair

**Introduction**
The proposed system will be a standalone application to track customer pull lists for Dragon’s Lair. The main functionalities will include tracking a list of customers and their contact information, tracking a list of comics that the store carries, and keeping a list of orders that the customers have for each comic book title. As has already been stated, a focus of this project is to increase employees’ efficiency by making the system easy to use, so the user interface will be friendly, easy to navigate, and easy to read.

The system will also be able to flag new releases. This process will be able to be done manually as well as automatically by importing a csv file of the new releases for that week. Additionally, the system will generate a variety of reports. This includes a list of orders for a customer, a list of customers for a title, a list of all orders and their quantities, and most importantly a list of all flagged new releases with customer information for each.
